experiment:
    name: "Robotic Arm"
    description: >
        This experiment will investigate enbodiment
        of a robotic arm in pigeons. The task will
        consist of a 2AFC-Task with differently
        rewarded pecking keys at different positions.
        First, subjects should learn to maximize food
        reward, and then move to choice optimization
        by considering the choice reachability. Next,
        subjects will be trained to solve the task by
        activating the keys with a robotic arm instead
        of pecking. This will enlarge their previous
        reachability and allow to adapt optimal choices
        to their new reachability. Optimality will
        be defined relative to the agents body.
